# Mapping_Earthquakes

The purspose of this Module Challenge was to create an earthquake map with three different maps and the earthquake overlay.  In addition the tectonic plates were added.  This allows the user to see the relationship between earthquakes and tectonic plates.  The module also separates out the earthquakes between all earthquakes and major earthquakes (which are classified as a magnitude of greater than 4.5).
